A practice web landing page using some pics from travels in Japan.

Next stop on the journey - making a slightly prettier website landing
page using my new rudimentary CSS skills.

Through this project I am hoping to build my confidence both in 
applying the CSS and HTML knowledge I have acquired so far, as well 
as improve my problem solving skills. Study so far has entailed a
fair degree of desperate googling, but as I understand it this is an
integral and accepted part of the coding process!

Let's hope I don't make any phenomenally stupid mistakes, and if I do
let's further hope that I don't make the same stupid mistakes twice!

Will report back from the other side.

After a good deal of head scratching and trial and error, I have
managed to put together what I think is a halfway decent looking
web page! Am starting to get the handle on how you need to think
regarding layout, specifically boxes nested in boxes nested in
flexy flexy boxes, but there wasn't anything that I wanted to do that
proved utterly impossible! 

Made an effort to personalise the whole thing, too, rather than
blindly following the original template. May revisit this later, add
a few more pages and flesh it out to something a bit more flashy 
once I have a bit more skill!

Overall, pleased with results, and the design aspect of it was very 
enjoyable.
