A practice web landing page using some pics from travels in Japan.

Next stop on the journey - making a slightly prettier website landing
page using my new rudimentary CSS skills.

Through this project I am hoping to build my confidence both in 
applying the CSS and HTML knowledge I have acquired so far, as well 
as improve my problem solving skills. Study so far has entailed a
fair degree of desperate googling, but as I understand it this is an
integral and accepted part of the coding process!

Let's hope I don't make any phenomenally stupid mistakes, and if I do
let's further hope that I don't make the same stupid mistakes twice!

Will report back from the other side.
